 I have a profound knack for profiling, preparing, visualizing, and interpreting data using IBM Cognos Analytics 11. Some techniques I am familiar with include visualizing data with bar charts, line charts, tables, crosstabs, lists, maps, queries, filters, prompts, page sets, active reports, master-detail relationships, Marimekko charts, Pie Charts, Bullet charts, etc. 

I can also leverage and deploy AI models within Cognos Analytics to help your business or your department identify key trends or problem areas within your data. 

In addition, I can create interactive and highly visual presentations for executives within your organization using live data from your database systems. You can send me some data, and using the accessible version of Cognos Analytics, I can create some dashboards for you to get an idea of my skill level.
